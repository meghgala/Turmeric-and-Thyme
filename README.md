# [Turmeric And Thyme](https://tuermeric-and-thyme.onrender.com/index)
This website was developed as a hobby project to learn and refine my full-stack development skills mostly focusing on the backend. The website serves as a repository for 
your recipes and also as a source of inspiration by having a look at other recipes. As a user, you can do the following activities on this website :

- View all the uploaded recipes
- Search recipes by ingredient or dish name
- Upload a detailed recipe with an image (Only after signing up)
- Signup or Login
- Click a button for any random recipe suggestion

After a user has logged in, the website uses a JWT cookie which is active for 3 days for making it easy to use and more convenient. 

### The project was made using the following tech stack:
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB
- JWT(JSON Web Token)
- Embedded Javascript (EJS)
- HTML and CSS
- Third-party APIs for validation
